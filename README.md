# SECURITY-OF-SYSTEMS-AND-APPLICATIONS
all my practical work in the field of Security of Systems and Applications in 2022


### TP1 :
* Introduction to encryption: terminology includes encryption, cryptology, cryptography, and cryptogram.
* Ciphering = encrypting? (decipher = decrypt)?
* Cesar cipher! (implementation) Shift encryption!
* Why encryption? What purpose does it serve?



### TP2 :
* Symmetric encryption vs asymmetric encryption.
* Digital signatures?!
* Hash functions.
* VPNs.



### TP3 :
* Network scan and enumeration.
* Tools such as NMAP, ZENMAP.
* What's the goal?



### TP4 :
* Accessing remote systems (exploiting services with Metasploit or Armitage).
* Understanding Metasploit.
* Finding suitable payloads for identified vulnerabilities.
* Learning to create payloads.



### TP5 :
* Web App testing: XSS (two types), tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp.
* Searching for remote command execution.
* SQL injection (methods, tools, primary keys).
* Using BEEF XSS (VirtualBox).



### TP6 :
* Man in the Middle (what, how, why).
* ARP poisoning vs DNS poisoning.
* Tools: Ettercap, Bettercap, MITMF (find other tools if possible).
* Sniffing packets with Wireshark (example: extracting cookies).
* SSL strip?



### TP7 :
* Social Engineering (what, why, how).
* Combining with Man in the Middle.
* Tools: SET (Social-Engineer Toolkit).
